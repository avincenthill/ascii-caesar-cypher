# ascii-caesar-cypher
An ASCII-table rotation cypher web-application made with Javascript, CSS, HTML, and jQuery. Enter a numerical shift and English phrase to encrypt, then decrypt it with the same shift or brute force all possible shifts. Also includes a letter frequency analyzer that only gives the five most-likely to be English parsed phrases and shifts back from an encrypted string.
